Instructions on how to use the Milestone 2 Course Registration System:

Note: We have attached two text files in the project folder called courses.txt and students.txt. These will be loaded into our
program for milestone and simulate our applications database.

1. First Run the java program called ServerController (this is our server class).
2. Run the java program called ClientController (this is our client class). A GUI will pop allowing you
to enter a UCID number.
3. Enter a UCID number from the student.txt file (the UCID is the number after the name of each student on each line) into the 
UCID text field and then press login. (The other GUI features on that panel will be implemented for milestone 3 for bonus).
4. Once you have pressed login a new GUI frame will pop up which is the student menu allowing you to search for a catalogue
course, add or remove a course to the repsective student you loggeed in as, view all the courses in the catalogue, view that students
courses or just exit the program.
